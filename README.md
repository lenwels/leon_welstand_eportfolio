## How to get started

**Step 1 — Create a free GitHub account**
Go to [github.com](https://github.com), click **Sign up**, and create an account. Your username will appear in your website link, so pick something professional (e.g. `alex-johnson`).

**Step 2 — Get your own copy of this project**
Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page. This copies the whole project into your own GitHub account so you can edit it freely.

**Step 3 — Turn it into a live website**
In your copy, go to **Settings → Pages → Source → main branch → Save**. GitHub will publish your files as a real website. It takes about 60 seconds.

**Step 4 — Find your live link**
After saving, refresh the Settings → Pages screen. Your link will appear — it looks like:
`https://your-username.github.io/undergrad-eportfolio-tutorial/`

**Step 5 — Edit the files to make it yours**
Click on any file (start with `index.html`), click the pencil icon to edit, replace the placeholder text, and click **Commit changes**. Your live site updates within a minute.

For photos, resume upload, and everything else, read [`HOSTING_GUIDE.md`](HOSTING_GUIDE.md) — it explains every step from scratch.

## Change the colour scheme

Open `css/style.css` and change these 4 lines at the top. Every button, link, and highlight on every page will update.

```css
:root {
  --accent:      #2563eb;   /* main colour */
  --accent-dark: #1d4ed8;   /* hover colour */
  --bg:          #f8fafc;   /* page background */
  --surface:     #ffffff;   /* card background */
}
```

## Why no JavaScript?

Everything — the mobile menu, progress bar animations, hover effects — works with CSS only. This means no installs, no setup, and no broken dependencies. If you want to add JavaScript later, `AI_PROMPTS.md` has prompts to help you do that.
